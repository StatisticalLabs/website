# Server-related Statistics

Once you invite Statistical, the bot will start tracking your server's messages and reactions. If you want to opt-out, you can read [this page](/docs/server-related-stats/opt-out).

## Statistics the bot tracks

- Messages: The amount of messages sent.
- Characters: The amount of characters in each message sent.
- Reactions: The amount of reactions made.
  - Adding a reaction makes the count go up by 1.
  - Removing a reaction makes the count go down by 1.

## Statistic "groups"

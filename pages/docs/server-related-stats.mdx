# Server-related statistics

Once you invite Statistical, the bot will start tracking your server's messages and reactions.

## Opting out

If you don't want Statistical to track your server's messages and reactions, run `/optout` and it won't track your server.

## Statistics the bot tracks

- Messages: The amount of messages sent.
- Characters: The amount of characters in each message sent.
- Reactions: The amount of reactions made.
  - Adding a reaction makes the count go up by 1.
  - Removing a reaction makes the count go down by 1.

## Statistic "groups"

- Global: Statistics across all servers the user is in and Statistical is tracking.
- Server: Statistics on the current server.

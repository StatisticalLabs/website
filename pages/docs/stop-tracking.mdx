# Stop tracking a channel

If you want to stop tracking a channel, you can use the `/unwatch` command.

You can select a channel by either typing it's name and selecting it among the options, copy-pasting their channel ID, or using their handle.

You should see a message like this:
![Successful Untrack Example](/docs/successful_untrack.png)

This confirms that you have successfully stopped tracking that channel. Congratulations!

## Alternative

You can also click the `Stop tracking this channel` button on any of it's subscriber count updates. It is the same as running `/unwatch`.

## Any problems?

If you don't see a message like that, make sure to check `/watching` to see if it isn't on the list. If it is, make sure to contact us on [Discord](/discord).

# Tracking a channel

To track a channel, you can use the `/watch` command.

You can select a channel by either typing it's name and selecting it among the options, copy-pasting their channel ID, or using their handle.

You should see a message like this:
![Successful Track Example](/docs/successful_track.png)

This confirms that you have successfully tracked that channel. Congratulations!

## Any problems?

If you don't see a message like that, make sure to check `/watching` to see if it is on the list. If it doesn't, make sure to contact us on [Discord](/discord).

# Leaderboards

We have leaderboards for both global and server statistics.

To view a leaderboard, you can run `/leaderboard [group] [category]`. An example is `/leaderboard global characers`.

import { Callout } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Don't know what groups are or what categories exist? Make sure to read [this
  page first](/docs/server-related-stats)! We detail it a lot more over there.
</Callout>

You should see a message like this:
![Leaderboard Example](/docs/server-related-stats/leaderboard_example.png)

It shows the top 10 in that category.

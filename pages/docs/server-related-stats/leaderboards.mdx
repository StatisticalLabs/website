# Leaderboards

We have leaderboards for both global and server statistics.

To view a leaderboard, you can run `/leaderboard [group] [category]`. An example is `/leaderboard global characers`.

You should see a message like this:
![Leaderboard Example](/docs/server-related-stats/leaderboard_example.png)

It shows the top 10 in that category.

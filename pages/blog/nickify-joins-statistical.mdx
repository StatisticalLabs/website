# Nickify joins Statistical Labs!

<Date>Wednesday, May 3rd, 2023</Date>

<Authors authors={["toasteddev"]} />

I am proud to announce that [Nickify](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1055073180970127370&permissions=134236160&scope=bot%20applications.commands), a Discord bot that allows you to add your subscriber count to your username, is now joining us at Statistical Labs!

## What is Nickify?

As described before, Nickify is a Discord bot that allows you, or anyone to add their subscriber count to their nickname. It gives people who look at your name while chatting to instantly see how many subscribers you have.

## What do you plan to do with Nickify?

So far we plan on improving it's featureset and speed. We have already figured out the speed problem with our main bot, Statistical, so expect a speed increase in the updates of nicknames in the near future!

We're also working hard to let server owners add their subscriber count to their nickname, but that is not possible currently due to Discord limits for all users which disables the modifying of a server owner's nickname.

We also might include it's feature(s) onto the main Statistical bot, but we're still deciding on that.

## Final remarks

This is just the beginning of something new. We hope to improve Nickify in the coming weeks to give it's users a better experience.

But that's all from us. Thank you for trusting in Statistical Labs!

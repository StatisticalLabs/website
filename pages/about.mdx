# About Statistical

The idea of Statistical was originally inspired from LCXYZ Stats Bot, made by [@mixaxern on YouTube](https://youtube.com/@mixaxern). The bot was shut down during early February, and it left every single server.

[ToastedToast](https://github.com/ToastedDev) decided he wanted to make his own version. Thanks to the community, the bot has grown tremendously over the past few months.

## Team

Currently, the development team only consists of [ToastedToast](https://github.com/ToastedDev), but the community gives us a helping hand by giving us ideas and reporting bugs.

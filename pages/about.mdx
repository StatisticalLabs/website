# About

The idea of Statistical was originally inspired from LCXYZ Stats Bot, made by [NiaAxern](https://youtube.com/@mixaxern). The bot was shut down during early February, and it left every single server.

[ToastedToast](https://github.com/ToastedDev) decided he wanted to make his own version. Thanks to the community, the bot has grown tremendously over the past few months.

## Team

Our team is currently pretty small, but soon we'll open up applications so you can help! You can also [contribute to the Statistical repository on GitHub](https://github.com/StatisticalLabs/bot).
